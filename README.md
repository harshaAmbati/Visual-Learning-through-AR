<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

Education is the most important thing in everyone's life. Traditional approaches like using blackboards and static textbooks are still being followed. Research shows that students are getting bored and fed up with these old methods in this new technological era. For educational institutions, labs are the backbone of teaching students how things work in the real world. this could be expensive and not everyone can afford it. New ways need to be introduced and integrated into education with the help of technology to make learning easy and fun. With the help of Unity 3d, spark AR, and Vuforia SDK. we are going to develop immersive augmented reality experiences so that students can get access to quality education. Augmented reality labs are immersive, interactive, and lifelike, which means they may help students to understand and learn how to control things in a real environment.

<h3>Scope and functions carried</h3>
1.	To Introduce Augmented reality books in place of traditional static books, to transform the way of learning in education.
2.	To create immersive AR experiences so that students can visualize in real time.
3.	Creating a new way to learn things using Augmented reality.
4.	Making the app easily accessible to students and teachers to get started.
